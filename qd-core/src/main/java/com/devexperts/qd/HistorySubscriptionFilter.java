 * Filter for history subscription to avoid memory overload with history.
 * It can control on what minimum time subscription can be made and what maximal
 * number of records can be kept. It is invoked on any incoming subscription
 * through {@link QDAgent} and outgoing subscription through {@link QDDistributor}
 * and the corresponding subscription is trimmed, so that it does not exceed minimum.
 * This trimming is performed only initially (on subscription).
 * After successful subscription it stays forever. Record count is enforced
 * only any incoming data. If record count exceeds limit, then earlier data
 * (with earliest time) is discarded.
