/**
 * The <code>CompactChar</code> utility class provides algorithms for compact
 * serialization of characters and strings. It uses <tt>CESU-8</tt> format
 * (the format close to <tt>UTF-8</tt> but with special handling of surrogate
 * characters). This is generally the same format as used by standard Java I/O
 * streams, though Java uses modified <tt>CESU-8</tt> (Java represents character
 * with code 0 using 2-byte encoding, not 1-byte as required).
 *
 * When encoding character sequences, the <code>CompactChar</code> uses
 * <code>CompactInt</code> to encode character sequence length first,
 * then serializes characters themselves. The value -1 for length is used
 * as a marker to distinguish 'null' sequence from empty sequence.
 *
 * See <A href="http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr26/tr26-2.html">CESU-8</A>
 * for format basics.
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> this class is deprecated and is replaced by {@link IOUtil} class.
 * See {@link IOUtil} class, section <b>UTF</b> APU, and individual methods for documentation.
 *
 * @deprecated Use {@link IOUtil} class instead.
