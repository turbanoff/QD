/**
 * The <code>DataVisitor</code> defines protocol of serial access to the data
 * using Visitor pattern. It allows data provider with complicated data storage
 * effectively give away data to external data consumer.
 * <p>
 * Specifically, <code>DataVisitor</code> allows data provider to take proper
 * synchronization locks only once per large data block (and not per visited entity)
 * and save on navigation through data storage by calculating and caching locally
 * required references and indices.
 * <p>
 * Therefore, the implementor of <code>DataVisitor</code> must perform its operations
 * quickly without need for synchronization and prolonged external actions for each step.
 * If data consumer in its turn requires synchronized access or is otherwise slow,
 * then it should accept {@link DataIterator} as a source of data and use
 * intermediate data buffer ({@link DataBuffer} or equivalent).
 * <p>
 * The <code>DataVisitor</code> visits all available data records and for each record
 * it visits all fields in their serial order (see {@link DataRecord}).
 * The corresponding state diagram is shown below (note that the number and types of
 * visited fields exactly matches number and types of the fields in the current record):
 * <pre>
 * +-----&gt; [Ready]
 * |          |
 * |          1 visitRecord
 * |          |
 * |          V
 * |  +--&gt; [Visiting Int]
 * |  |       |
 * |  +-------* visitIntField
 * |          |
 * |          V
 * |  +--&gt; [Visiting Obj]
 * |  |       |
 * |  +-------* visitObjField
 * |          |
 * +----------+
 * </pre>
 * <b>NOTE:</b> if visiting is ever aborted in a state different from [Ready],
 * then behavior of both parties (data visitor and data provider) is undefined.
 *
 * <h3>Legacy interface</h3>
 *
 * <b>FUTURE DEPRECATION NOTE:</b>
 *    New code shall not implement this interface due to its complexity and inherent slowness.
 *    Use {@link AbstractRecordSink} or {@link RecordBuffer}
 *    as a high-performance implementation of it. New code is also discouraged from using this
 *    interface unless it is need for interoperability with legacy code. Various legacy APIs
 *    will be gradually migrated to NG interfaces and classes.
