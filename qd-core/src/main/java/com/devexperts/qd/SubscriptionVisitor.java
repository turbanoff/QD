 * The <code>SubscriptionVisitor</code> provides serial access to subscription.
 * It follows the same pattern as <code>DataVisitor</code> except it does not go
 * through data fields.
 * <p>
 * <b>NOTE:</b> This interface is formally unrelated to its data analogue to enforce
 * strict type safety; also their state diagrams are not compatible.
 *
 * <h3>Legacy interface</h3>
 *
 * <b>FUTURE DEPRECATION NOTE:</b>
 *    New code shall not implement this interface due to its complexity and inherent slowness.
 *    Use {@link AbstractRecordSink} or {@link RecordBuffer}
 *    as a high-performance implementation of it. New code is also discouraged from using this
 *    interface unless it is need for interoperability with legacy code. Various legacy APIs
 *    will be gradually migrated to NG interfaces and classes.
