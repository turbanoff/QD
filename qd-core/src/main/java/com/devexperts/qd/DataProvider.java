 *    New code shall not implement this interface due to its complexity and inherent slowness.
 *    Extend {@link AbstractRecordProvider} or use {@link RecordBuffer}

 *    New code is also discouraged from using this interface unless it is need for interoperability with
 *    legacy code. Various legacy APIs will be gradually migrated to NG interfaces and classes.
