/**
 * Writes data to the stream using Comma-Separated Values (CSV) format.
 * See <a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4180.txt">RFC 4180</a> for CSV format specification.
 * <p>
 * This writer supports records with arbitrary (variable) number of fields, multiline fields,
 * custom separator and quote characters. It uses <b>CRLF</b> sequence to separate records.
 * <p>
 * This writer does not provide buffering of any sort and does not perform encoding.
 * The correct way to efficiently write CSV file with UTF-8 encoding is as follows:
 * <pre>
 * CSVWriter writer = new CSVWriter(new BufferedWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(new FileOutputStream(file), StandardCharsets.UTF_8)));
 * writer.writeRecord(header);
 * writer.writeAll(records);
 * writer.close();
 * </pre>
