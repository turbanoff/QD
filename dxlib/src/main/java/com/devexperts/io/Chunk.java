/**
 * <p>A chunk of binary data.
 * Each {@code Chunk} holds a fixed-sized {@link #getBytes() byte array}
 * that may be used to store arbitrary binary data; {@link #getOffset() offset}
 * and {@link #getLength() length} properties are used to define the range
 * of significant data within the array.
 *
 * <h3>Pooling</h3>
 *
 * <p>Chunks are usually reused within the system; in such cases each
 * {@code Chunk} corresponds to some {@link ChunkPool pool} instance.
 * A chunk may be acquired from the specified pool by invocation of
 * {@link ChunkPool#getChunk(Object) getChunk(owner)} method and after being used
 * it may be returned back to the pool by {@link #recycle(Object) recycle(owner)} method.
 * (The <i>owner</i> argument of these methods will be described below.)
 *
 * <p>It is is also possible to create a chunk without binding it with any pool,
 * simply by {@link #wrap(byte[], Object) wrapping} a given byte array.
 * 
 * <h3>Linear type &amp; chunk owners</h3>
 *
 * <p>The concept of a chunk is concerned with the concept of a
 * <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_type">linear type</a>.
 * The main idea is that there may always exist at most one reference
 * for every chunk within the system.
 * Each time a reference to some chunk instance is passed from one part
 * of the system to another (e.g. as some method argument or return value,
 * by assignment to another variable or in any other way) it may
 * no longer be used in its previous location.
 *
 * <p>In order to ensure that every chunk may be used from a single place at any
 * moment of time, the <b>owner</b> for every chunk is introduced.
 * Each chunk always corresponds to exactly one owner, representing the current
 * part of the system which this chunk currently belongs to.
 * A reference to any arbitrary object may be used as an owner for a chunk.
 * Each time a chunk is passed to another part of the system, its owner
 * is validated and changed to a new value.
 * This operation is called <b>{@link #handOver(Object, Object) handover}</b>.
 *
 * <p>Each handover or modification operation requires to be provided with
 * the reference to the current owner of the chunk, and it fails with
 * {@link IllegalStateException} in case this reference is incorrect.
 * Thus, only the true owner of the chunk may modify it or hand it over
 * to someone else (and it may do this at most once).
 *
 * <p>Note, that {@link #getBytes()} method, however, does not validate
 * the owner, in spite of the fact that it may be used to modify the contents
 * of the chunk. Moreover, this method potentially allows to store the
 * reference for the underlying byte array of the chunk even after it was
 * recycled or handed over to someone else <b>(which is strictly forbidden)</b>.
 * Therefore it must be used with great care (see {@link #getBytes() method
 * documentation} for more details on its usage).
 * 
 * <h3>Recycling</h3>
 *
 * <p>When a chunk is no longer needed and is not passed anywhere else,
 * it should be returned into its pool via {@link #recycle(Object) recycle(owner)} method.
 * Recycling a chunk implies its handover from the current owner to the pool,
 * so a chunk may no longer be used after being recycled, as well as it
 * may not be recycled if is passed somewhere else (in the latter case
 * it is recipient's responsibility to recycle the chunk after it is
 * no longer needed).
 *
 * <h3>Modifiable and read-only chunks</h3>
 *
 * <p>In case it is required to pass the same chunk into several different places
 * or to store its underlying binary data somewhere for a long time without
 * knowing exactly whether it is still used or not,
 * {@link #markReadOnly(Object) markReadOnly(owner)} method may be used. This method marks
 * the chunk as <b>read-only</b> and since this moment it is excluded
 * from pooling turnover. In order to check whether a chunk is read-only
 * or not {@link #isReadOnly()} method can be used.
 *
 * <p>All read-only chunks are owned by special <b>read-only owner</b>, which
 * means that they are actually owned by everybody except for the fact that
 * no one may modify them.
 * {@link #handOver(Object, Object) Handing over} read-only chunk is, however,
 * still allowed: it just does not actually change the owner.
 * In particular, invocation of {@link #recycle(Object) recycle(owner)} method would have
 * no effect on a read-only chunk.
 *
 * <p>All modifying methods (such as {@link #setLength(int, Object) setLength(length, owner)} and
 * {@link #setRange(int, int, Object) setRange(offset, length, owner)}) would throw an {@link IllegalStateException}
 * on a read-only chunk. The underlying byte array, however, may still be accessed and, thus, modified but this is
 * <b>strictly forbidden</b> by convention.
 *
 * <p>All chunks are modifiable (not read-only) by default. A chunk once marked as
 * read-only can never become modifiable again.
 * References to read-only chunks may be spawned and stored infinitely because
 * they would never be modified or recycled and reused again by anyone.
 *
 * <h3>Hand-over convention</h3>
 *
 * By convention, every method that accepts chunk and owner in parameters
 * takes ownership of the chunk via {@link #handOver(Object, Object) handOver} method or
 * recycles it via {@link #recycle(Object) recyle} method, so an original owner of the
 * chunk can no longer use it after invocation of such a method, unless the chunk is read-only, in which
 * case it can be still used (both methods do nothing when chunk is read-only).
 *
 * <h3>Threads and locks</h3>
 *
 * <b>This class is not thread-safe</b>. It cannot be safely updated from multiple threads at the same time.
 * Code that is using chunks shall include its own synchronization, especially to guarantee correct
 * operation of hand-over protocol.
 *
 * <p>The only only exception are {@link #isReadOnly() read-only} chunks that can be used (for read only)
 * concurrently from multiple threads.
