/**
 * A collection designed for pooling elements so that they can be reused later.
 * This class is primarily designed for pooling of very, very large objects that occupy a lot of memory and
 * are extremely expensive to create, to make sure that as few as possible of those objects are allocated
 * and are kept in the pool.
 *
 * <p>The <tt>LockFreePool</tt> is a fixed-capacity (or &quot;bounded&quot;)
 * stack as it orders elements in a LIFO (last-in-first-out) manner.
 * This class is a thread-safe and provides lock-free access.
 *
 * <p>If you need a pool of moderately-sized objects that may be needed so often, as to raise concern about
 * contention on this {@code LockFreePool} implementation and memory locality concerns on object reuse,
 * then use {@link ThreadLocalPool} class and keeps an additional per-thread pool of objects.
 *
 * @param <E> type of elements kept in this pool.
