/**
 * Ensures smooth transition from older versions of services interfaces to their newer versions.
 *
 * <p>For example, assume there was a service interface or class {@code A}. It was superseded by
 * {@code B extends A} which is annotated with {@code @SupersedesService(A.class)}. A becomes deprecated.
 * The first step in migration is to change all users for {@code A} to {@code B}.
 * This is where {@code SupersedesService} annotation comes into play, since {@link Services} will
 * find providers for {@code A}, if being requested to find providers of {@code B}.
 *
 * <p>As soon as
 * all users of the service had migrated, providers can start providing {@code B} instead of {@code A}.
 * As soon as all providers had migrated, deprecated {@code A} can be removed altogether.
