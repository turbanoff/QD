/**
 * Extends {@link DXFeedSubscription} to conveniently subscribe to time-series of
 * events for a set of symbols and event types. This class decorates symbols
 * that are passed to {@code xxxSymbols} methods in {@link DXFeedSubscription}
 * by wrapping them into {@link TimeSeriesSubscriptionSymbol} instances with
 * the current value of {@link #getFromTime() fromTime} property.
 * While {@link #getSymbols() getSymbols} method returns original (undecorated)
 * symbols, any installed {@link ObservableSubscriptionChangeListener} will see
 * decorated ones.
 *
 * <p> Only events that implement {@link TimeSeriesEvent} interface can be
 * subscribed to with {@code DXFeedTimeSeriesSubscription}.
 *
 * <h3>From time</h3>
 *
 * The value of {@link #getFromTime() fromTime} property defines the time-span of
 * events that are subscribed to. Only events that satisfy
 * {@code event.getEventTime() >= thisSubscription.getFromTime()} are looked for.
 *
 * <p> The value {@code fromTime} is initially set to {@link Long#MAX_VALUE Long.MAX_VALUE}
 * with a special meaning that no events will be received until {@code fromTime} is
 * changed with {@link #setFromTime(long) setFromTime} method.
 *
 * <h3>Threads and locks</h3>
 *
 * This class is thread-safe and can be used concurrently from multiple threads without external synchronization.
 *
 * @param <E> the type of events.
