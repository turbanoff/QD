/**
 * Subscription for a set of symbols and event types.
 *
 * <h3>Symbols and event types</h3>
 *
 * Symbols are represented by objects, simple keys are represented by {@link String} objects,
 * complex ones use specialized object as described in the corresponding event types.
 * However, every symbol has a unique string representation that can be used.
 * Each event is represented by a concrete instance of
 * event class. Event type is represented by a class literal. For example,
 * <ul>
 * <li>"SPY" is a symbol for SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF,
 * <li>{@code Quote.class} is an event type for a best market quote.
 * </ul>
 * Events can be represented by any classes that annotated by an inheritable annotation {@link EventType}.
 * Common types of market events extend {@link MarketEvent MarketEvent} class
 * and reside in <a href="../event/market/package-summary.html"><code>com.dxfeed.event.market</code></a> package.
 *
 * <p> The set of subscribed symbols and the set of subscribed event types are maintained separately.
 * The subscription is considered to be interested in the cross-product of these sets. That is, subscription
 * is interested in any event whose type is in the set of subscribed event types and whose symbol is in the
 * set of subscribed symbols.
 *
 * <p> The set of event types is specified when subscription is created and cannot be changed afterward.
 * The set of symbols can be modified with
 * {@link #setSymbols(Collection) setSymbols}, {@link #addSymbols(Collection) addSymbols},
 * {@link #removeSymbols(Collection) removeSymbols}, and {@link #clear() clear} methods.
 * Each of {@code xxxSymbols} method exists in two version. One version accepts a {@link Collection}
 * of symbols and it recommended for bulk modifications of symbol set. The other version accepts
 * varargs arrays of symbols and is provided as a convenience method to set/add/remove one or few
 * symbols.
 *
 * <p>Symbols in a set are compared using their {@link Object#equals(Object) equals} method. All symbol objects
 * must properly support {@link Object#hashCode() hashCode} method. A set of symbols cannot contain two equal symbols.
 * If a symbol that is {@link #addSymbols(Collection) added} to a set of symbols is equal to the other one,
 * then the old symbol is removed from the set and the new symbol instance is retained. However,
 * the {@link ObservableSubscriptionChangeListener} (see below) in this case is notified on the change of
 * subscription only when new symbol object implements {@link FilteredSubscriptionSymbol} marker interface.
 *
 * <h3>Special symbol types and restrictions</h3>
 *
 * A single object {@link WildcardSymbol#ALL WildcardSymbol.ALL} represents subscription to all possible symbols
 * and have the effect of subscribing to all of them. See {@link WildcardSymbol} for more details. It
 * is always represented by a separate class (instead of a usual {@link String}) in order
 * to avoid potential resource consumption problems that may stem from an accidental subscription via wildcard.
 * All string symbols that start with {@link WildcardSymbol#RESERVED_PREFIX WildcardSymbol.RESERVED_PREFIX} ("*")
 * are reserved for the same reason. Subscription to the corresponding string does not have any effect
 * (no events will be received). Thus, it is safe to add user-specified strings to the subscription via
 * {@link #addSymbols(Object...) addSymbols} method without any prior validation of the user input.
 *
 * <p><b>NOTE:</b> Wildcard subscription can create extremely high network and CPU load for certain kinds of
 * high-frequency events like quotes. It requires a special arrangement on the side of upstream data provider and
 * is disabled by default in upstream feed configuration. Make that sure you have adequate resources and understand
 * the impact before using it. It can be used for low-frequency events only (like Forex quotes), because each instance
 * of {@code DXFeedSubscription} processes events in a single thread and there is no provision to load-balance wildcard
 * subscription amongst multiple threads.
 *
 * Contact your data provider for the corresponding configuration arrangement if needed.
 * <p> A special class of {@link TimeSeriesSubscriptionSymbol} symbols is used internally to represent a subscription
 * to time-series of events. Two instances of {@link TimeSeriesSubscriptionSymbol} objects are
 * {@link TimeSeriesSubscriptionSymbol#equals(Object) equal} when their
 * {@link TimeSeriesSubscriptionSymbol#getEventSymbol() underlying symbols} are equal, thus only one, most recently
 * added, instance of {@link TimeSeriesSubscriptionSymbol} will be kept in the set of subscribed symbols.
 *
 * <p>It is recommended to use {@link DXFeedTimeSeriesSubscription} convenience class for time-series subscriptions.
 *
 * <p>{@link Candle} events use {@link CandleSymbol} class to represent the complex structure of the candle symbol
 * and its attributes. However, both {@link String} and {@link CandleSymbol} objects can be used in subscription.
 * The corresponding strings will be converted to {@link CandleSymbol} using its {@link CandleSymbol#valueOf(String) valueOf}
 * method. Do not mix {@link String} and {@link CandleSymbol} subscription in a single {@code DXFeedSubscription} instance.
 *
 * <h3>Subscription listeners</h3>
 *
 * This class keeps a list of {@link DXFeedEventListener} instances that are notified on any events.
 * Event listeners are added with {@link #addEventListener(DXFeedEventListener) addEventListener} method.
 * <b>Event listeners must be installed before changing the set of subscribed symbols</b>.
 * When the set of subscribed symbols changes all registered event listeners receive update on the
 * last events for all newly added symbols.
 *
 * <p> This class keeps a set of {@link ObservableSubscriptionChangeListener} instances that are notified on any
 * change in subscription. These listeners are installed by {@link DXFeed} to keep
 * track of the subscription state and communicate subscription upstream to data providers.
 *
 * <h3>Detached and attached subscriptions</h3>
 *
 * Subscription that is created via constructor is <i>detached</i>. It is not attached
 * to any feed and thus it does not actually receive any events. Detached subscription still maintains
 * a set of symbols and a list of event listeners. Detached subscription can be attached to
 * any feed with {@link DXFeed#attachSubscription DXFeed.attachSubscription} method.
 *
 * <p> Subscription that is created via {@link DXFeed#createSubscription DXFeed.createSubscription}
 * is <i>attached</i> to the
 * corresponding feed. The feed tracks all changes in subscription by installing
 * {@link ObservableSubscriptionChangeListener} and invokes
 * {@link #processEvents processEvents} for all received events.
 * Subscription can be detached from the feed with
 * {@link DXFeed#detachSubscription DXFeed.detachSubscription} method.
 *
 * <p> Subscription can be attached to multiple feeds at the same time. In this case it receives events from
 * all feeds but there is no way distinguish which feed the corresponding event came from.
 *
 * <h3>Resource management and closed subscriptions</h3>
 *
 * Attached subscription is a potential memory leak. If the pointer to attached subscription is lost, then there is
 * no way to detach this subscription from the feed and the subscription will not be reclaimed by the garbage collector
 * as long as the corresponding feed is still used. Detached subscriptions can be reclaimed by the garbage collector,
 * but detaching subscription requires knowing the pointer to the feed at the place of the call, which is not always convenient.
 *
 * <p> The convenient way to detach subscription from the feed is to call its {@link #close close} method. Closed subscription
 * becomes permanently detached from all feeds, removes all its listeners and is guaranteed to be reclaimable by the garbage
 * collector as soon as all external references to it are cleared.
 *
 * <p> The other way is to close an associated feed. This cannot be done via a {@link DXFeed} instance, but it can be done
 * indirectly by closing the associated {@link DXEndpoint endpoint}.
 *
 * <h3>Serialization</h3>
 *
 * This class's serialized state includes only serializable listeners. {@link ObservableSubscriptionChangeListener}
 * that is installed by {@link DXFeed} when this subscription is attached is not serializable.
 * Thus, freshly deserialized instance of this class will be <i>detached</i>. It has to be attached
 * to the feed after deserialization in order for it to start receiving events.
 *
 * <h3><a name="threadsAndLocksSection">Threads and locks</a></h3>
 *
 * This class is thread-safe and can be used concurrently from multiple threads without external synchronization.
 *
 * <p> Installed {@link DXFeedEventListener} instances are invoked from a separate thread via the executor.
 * Default executor for all subscriptions is configured with {@link DXEndpoint#executor(Executor) DXEndpoint.executor}
 * method. Each subscription can individually override its executor with {@link #setExecutor(Executor) setExecutor}
 * method.
 *
 * <p> Event listeners are invoked in a serial manner with respect to a given DXFeedSubscription instance.
 * That is, next event notification will not be performed until
 * {@link DXFeedEventListener#eventsReceived(List) DXFeedEventListener.eventsReceived} method for the previous
 * notification completes. It guarantees that the order of events in a given instance of {@code DXFeedSubscription}
 * is preserved.
 *
 * <p> This requirement on ordering limits concurrency of event processing. Effectively, each
 * subscription can use at most one CPU core to process its events. If there is a need to simultaneously
 * process events on a large number of symbols and this event processing is so resource-consuming, that
 * one CPU core is not enough to process all events in real-time, then it is advised to split symbols between multiple
 * {@code DXFeedSubscription} instances. If event processing is mostly CPU-bound, then the good rule of thumb
 * is to have as many {@code DXFeedSubscription} instances as there are CPU cores in the system.
 *
 * <p> However, multiple tasks can get submitted to the executor at the same time. In the current implementation,
 * at most two tasks are submitted at any time if
 * {@link DXEndpoint#DXFEED_AGGREGATION_PERIOD_PROPERTY DXFEED_AGGREGATION_PERIOD_PROPERTY} is used.
 * One task for immediate processing of data snapshots via {@link Executor#execute(Runnable) Executor.execute} method
 * and another task for delayed processing of data updates via
 * {@link ScheduledExecutorService#schedule(Runnable, long, TimeUnit) ScheduledExecutorService.schedule} method
 * if the executor implements {@link ScheduledExecutorService} interface.
 * At most one task is submitted at any time if this property is not used.
 *
 * <p> Installed {@link ObservableSubscriptionChangeListener} instances are notified on symbol set changes
 * while holding the lock on this subscription and in the same thread that changed the set of subscribed symbols
 * in this subscription.
 *
 * <p>Custom executor can be used by backend applications that do not need to immediately retrieve a collection
 * of events, but want to poll for new events at a later time, for example, from inside of a servlet request.
 * The following code pattern is suggested in this case to initialize subscription's executor:
 *
 * <pre><tt>
 * {@link ConcurrentLinkedQueue}&lt;{@link Runnable Runnable}&gt; taskQueue = <b>new</b> ConcurrentLinkedQueue&lt;&gt;();
 * subscription.{@link #setExecutor(Executor) setExecutor}(<b>new</b> {@link Executor}() {
 *     <b>public void</b> execute({@link Runnable Runnable} task) {
 *         taskQueue.{@link ConcurrentLinkedQueue#add add}(task);
 *     }
 * });
 * subscription.{@link #addEventListener(DXFeedEventListener) addEventListener}(...);
 * </tt></pre>
 *
 * When there is a time to poll for new events, the following code can be used:
 *
 * <pre><tt>
 * {@link Runnable Runnable} task;
 * <b>while</b> ((task = taskQueue.{@link ConcurrentLinkedQueue#poll poll}()) != <b>null</b>)
 *     task.run();
 * </tt></pre>
 *
 * and event listener's {@link DXFeedEventListener#eventsReceived(List) eventsReceived} method will be invoked
 * in this thread from inside of {@code task.run()} invocation.
 *
 * <p> This approach has a clear advantage with {@link LastingEvent LastingEvent} types.
 * If the above polling code is delayed or is executed only periodically, then incoming events have a chance
 * to get conflated and listener will receive only on the most recent event updates for processing.
 *
 * @param <E> the type of events.
