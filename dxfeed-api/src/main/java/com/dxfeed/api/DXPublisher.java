/**
 * Provides API for publishing of events to local or remote {@link DXFeed feeds}.
 *
 * <h3>Sample usage</h3>
 *
 * This section gives sample usage scenarios.
 *
 * <h4>Default singleton instance</h4>
 *
 * There is a singleton instance of the publisher that is returned by {@link #getInstance()} method.
 * It is created on the first use with default configuration properties that are explained in detail in
 * documentation for {@link DXEndpoint} class in the "Default properties" section. In particular,
 * you can provide a default address to connect using
 * "{@link DXEndpoint#DXPUBLISHER_ADDRESS_PROPERTY dxpublisher.address}"
 * system property or by putting it into
 * "{@link DXEndpoint#DXPUBLISHER_PROPERTIES_PROPERTY dxpublisher.properties}"
 * file on JVM classpath.
 *
 * <h4>Publish a single event</h4>
 *
 * The following code publishes a single quote for a "A:TEST" symbol:
 * <pre><tt>
 * {@link Quote Quote} quote = new Quote("A:TEST");
 * quote.setBidPrice(100);
 * quote.setAskPrice(101);
 * {@link DXPublisher DXPublisher}.{@link #getInstance() getInstance}().{@link #publishEvents(Collection) publishEvents}(Arrays.asList(quote));</tt></pre>
 *
 * <h4>Monitor subscription and publish profile for any test symbol</h4>
 *
 * The following code monitor subscription for {@link Profile} events and for any subscription
 * on the string symbols that end with ":TEST" string generates and publishes a profile.
 *
 * <pre><tt>
 * final {@link DXPublisher DXPublisher} publisher = {@link DXPublisher DXPublisher}.{@link #getInstance() getInstance}();
 * publisher.{@link #getSubscription(Class) getSubscription}({@link Profile Profile}.class).{@link ObservableSubscription#addChangeListener(ObservableSubscriptionChangeListener) addChangeListener}(new {@link ObservableSubscriptionChangeListener ObservableSubscriptionChangeListener}() {
 *     public void {@link ObservableSubscriptionChangeListener#symbolsAdded(Set) symbolsAdded}(Set&lt;?&gt; symbols) {
 *         List&lt;Profile&gt; events = new ArrayList&lt;Profile&gt;();
 *         for (Object symbol : symbols) {
 *             if (symbol instanceof String) {
 *                 String s = (String)symbol;
 *                 if (s.endsWith(":TEST")) {
 *                     Profile profile = new Profile(s);
 *                     profile.setDescription("Test symbol");
 *                     events.add(profile);
 *                 }
 *             }
 *         }
 *         publisher.{@link #publishEvents(Collection) publishEvents}(events);
 *     }
 *
 *     public void symbolsRemoved(Set&lt;?&gt; symbols) {
 *         // nothing to do here
 *     }
 *
 *     public void subscriptionClosed() {
 *         // nothing to do here
 *     }
 * });</tt></pre>
 *
 * <h3>Threads and locks</h3>
 *
 * This class is thread-safe and can be used concurrently from multiple threads without external synchronization.
