/**
 * Represents subscription to time-series of events.
 * This is symbol is observed by {@link ObservableSubscriptionChangeListener}
 * methods {@link ObservableSubscriptionChangeListener#symbolsAdded(Set) symbolsAdded}
 * and {@link ObservableSubscriptionChangeListener#symbolsRemoved(Set) symbolsRemoved}
 * when time-series subscription is created via {@link DXFeedTimeSeriesSubscription} class.
 *
 * <p>Instances of this class can be used with {@link DXFeedSubscription} to specify subscription
 * for time series events from a specific time. By default, subscribing to time-series events by
 * their event symbol object, the subscription is performed to a stream of new events as they happen only.
 *
 * <p>{@link TimeSeriesEvent} represents a special subtype of {@link IndexedEvent}.
 * The source identifier of a time-series event is always zero and thus
 * {@link #getSource() getSource} method for time-series subscription symbol always returns
 * {@link IndexedEventSource#DEFAULT DEFAULT}.
 *
 * <h3>Equality and hash codes</h3>
 *
 * This is a {@link FilteredSubscriptionSymbol}.
 * Time-series subscription symbols are compared based on their {@link #getEventSymbol() eventSymbol} only.
 * It means, that a set of time-series subscription symbols can contain at most one time-series subscription
 * for each event symbol.
 *
 * @param <T> the type of the event symbol.
