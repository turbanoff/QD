/**
 * This marker interface marks subscription symbol classes (like {@link TimeSeriesSubscriptionSymbol})
 * that attach "filters" to the actual symbols. Filtered subscription symbols implement their
 * {@link Object#equals(Object)} and {@link Object#hashCode()} methods based on their symbol only,
 * without considering their "filter" part (for example, a {@link TimeSeriesSubscriptionSymbol} has
 * a {@link TimeSeriesSubscriptionSymbol#getFromTime() fromTime} filter on a time range of events).
 *
 * <p>{@link DXFeedSubscription} has the following behavior for filtered symbols. There can be only one
 * active filter per symbol. Adding new filtered symbol with the same symbol but different filter
 * removes the old one from subscription, adds the new one, and <em>notifies</em>
 * {@link ObservableSubscriptionChangeListener} <em>about this subscription change</em>.
 * The later is a special behaviour for filtered subscription symbols, because on other types of
 * symbols (like {@link String}, for example) there is no notification when replacing one symbol
 * with the other that is "equal" to the first one.
