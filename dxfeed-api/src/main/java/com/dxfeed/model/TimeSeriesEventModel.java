/**
 * Model for a list of time-series events.
 * This class handles all snapshot and transaction logic of {@link TimeSeriesEvent} class and
 * arranges incoming events into a {@link #getEventsList() list} ordered by their {@link TimeSeriesEvent#getTime() time}.
 *
 * <p>The model must be configured with {@link #setSymbol(Object) symbol} and {@link #setFromTime(long) fromTime}
 * to subscribe and {@link #attach(DXFeed) attached} to a {@link DXFeed} instance to start operation.
 *
 * <p>The view of the current list of events is available via {@link #getEventsList() getEventsList} method.
 * Model change notifications are provided via {@link ObservableListModel#addListener(ObservableListModelListener) addListener}
 * method of this list. It accepts an instance of {@link ObservableListModelListener} class.
 *
 * <p>Users of this model only see the list of events in a consistent state. This model delays incoming events which
 * are part of incomplete snapshot or ongoing transaction until snapshot is complete or transaction has ended.
 * These pending events cannot be seen neither via list nor via listener calls, and so
 * {@link IndexedEvent#getEventFlags() eventFlags} of events in the model are set to zero.
 * The eventFlags are only used and must be taken into account when processing time-series events directly via low-level
 * {@link DXFeedSubscription} or {@link DXFeedTimeSeriesSubscription} classes.
 *
 * <h3>Sample usage</h3>
 *
 * <p>dxFeed API comes with a set of samples. {@code DXFeedCandleChart} sample is a very simple UI application
 * that shows how to use this model with {@code Candle} event to paint a simple candle chart, concentrating your
 * effort on data representation (painting) logic, while delegating all the data-handling logic to this model.
 *
 * <h3>Threads and locks</h3>
 *
 * This class is <b>not</b> tread-safe and requires external synchronization.
 * You must query the state of {@link #attach(DXFeed) attached} model only from
 * inside of the notification invocations or from within the thread that performs
 * those notifications.
 *
 * <p> Installed {@link ObservableListModelListener} instances are invoked from a separate thread via the executor.
 * Default executor for all models is configured with {@link DXEndpoint#executor(Executor) DXEndpoint.executor}
 * method. Each model can individually override its executor with {@link #setExecutor(Executor) setExecutor}
 * method. The corresponding
 * {@link #modelChanged(List)  modelChanged}
 * notification is guaranteed to never be concurrent, even though it may happen from different
 * threads if executor is multi-threaded.
 *
 * <p>In practice, it means that is UI applications you <b>must</b>
 * install UI-thread-bound execution to your {@link DXEndpoint} via
 * {@link DXEndpoint#executor(Executor) DXEndpoint.executor} method, so that you
 * can freely use all methods of this model from UI thread.
 *
 * <p>Custom executor can be used by backend applications that do not need to immediately update this model on
 * arrival of new events, but want to update the model at a later time, for example, from inside of a servlet request.
 * This approach is explained with code samples in
 * <a href="../api/DXFeedSubscription.html#threadsAndLocksSection">Threads and locks</a>
 * section of {@link DXFeedSubscription} class documentation.
 *
 * @param <E> the type of events.
