/**
 * Underlying event is a snapshot of computed values that are available for an option underlying
 * symbol based on the option prices on the market.
 * It represents the most recent information that is available about the corresponding values on
 * the market at any given moment of time.
 *
 * <h3>Properties</h3>
 *
 * {@code Underlying} event has the following properties:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #getEventSymbol() eventSymbol} - symbol of this event;
 * <li>{@link #getVolatility() volatility} - 30-day implied volatility for this underlying based on VIX methodology;
 * <li>{@link #getFrontVolatility() frontVolatility} - front month implied volatility for this underlying based on VIX methodology;
 * <li>{@link #getBackVolatility() backVolatility} - 3back month implied volatility for this underlying based on VIX methodology;
 * <li>{@link #getPutCallRatio() putCallRatio} - ratio of put traded volume to call traded volume for a day.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>See <a href="package-summary.html#model">the model section</a> for a mathematical background on
 * the values in this event.
 *
 * <h3>Implementation details</h3>
 *
 * This event is implemented on top of QDS record {@code Underlying}.
